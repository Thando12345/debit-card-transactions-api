# Database Configuration Fix

The error "Table 'plusplusminus_db.debit_cards' doesn't exist" is occurring because:

1. The database configuration in `config/database.php` is set to use SQLite as the default connection, but the application is attempting to use MySQL
2. The migration log shows that migrations were attempted but may not have completed successfully in the target MySQL database

To resolve this issue:

1. Update your `.env` file with the correct MySQL database configuration:
```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=plusplusminus_db
DB_USERNAME=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

2. Create the MySQL database if it doesn't exist:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE plusplusminus_db;
```

3. Run the migrations:
```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh
```

This will:
- Set MySQL as the default database connection
- Ensure the database exists
- Create all necessary tables including the `debit_cards` table

Note: Make sure your MySQL server is running and accessible with the credentials you provide in the `.env` file.
